## Instructions

-   Html and pdf documents are in the "docs" folder;

-   Since we used the Bestsubset package, we decided to save the workspace in order to make the code reproducible. The main code files are "sim.R" and "nonzero.R" ("workspace.RData"); "dfplot.R" ("workspace_df.RData"). Both the workspace and the code can be found in the folder "code";

-   In the folders "fig5" and "fig5_t" are stored the output of the simulations (.RDS files) necessary to reproduce some of the plots

-   The plots are in the folder "plots" in "dcs";

-   Check "renv" folder for the virtual environment

-   compile the report and check the [compiled pdf](docs/report.pdf). It is  **reproducible**.
